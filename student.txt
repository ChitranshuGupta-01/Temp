I am Chitranshu Gupta from Noida, Uttar Pradesh, and I recently completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai. I am currently working as a Technology Apprentice at Standard Chartered and am excited to learn and contribute meaningfully to the team. My hobbies include cricket, exploring new technologies, and reading current affairs.

For my final year project, I worked on Wildlife Detection using YOLO v11, a novel effort that introduced SimAM, DySample, and Bounding Box-IoU techniques, and the work has been submitted for publication. I also have a strong interest in development, I have completed full-stack bootcamp during my training, where my team was recognized as the top team among 24 teams. I am looking forward to growing my skills further, learn from the team and adding value wherever I can.
