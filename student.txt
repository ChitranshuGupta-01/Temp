Got it üëç. I‚Äôll compress each user story into **2 clear and well-explained lines** while keeping the intent intact. Here‚Äôs the refined version:

---

### 1. Login & View Applications

As a Sales User, I want to log in securely with my credentials and get an overview of all open credit card applications.
The system should show key details like application ID, holder name, status, age, and sales handler, while notifying errors on failed login.

---

### 2. Submit & Edit Applications

As a Sales User, I want to create and submit a new credit card application with all mandatory fields.
I should also be able to edit any application that has already been submitted into the system.

---

### 3. Delete Applications

As a Sales User, I want the ability to delete a customer‚Äôs credit card application form.
This ensures removal of incorrect or unnecessary applications from the system.

---

### 4. Upload Documents & Retrieve Credit Score

As a Sales User, I want to upload and retrieve customer identity, address, and income proof documents into the system.
Once saved, the system should trigger credit bureau checks and fetch the customer‚Äôs credit score automatically.

---

### 5. Retrieve Initial Offer

As a Sales User, I want to get an initial credit card offer for the customer.
The system should fetch this offer automatically from the Credit Card Management System if the customer‚Äôs credit score is above 750.

---

### 6. Accept Offer & Process Application

As a Sales User, I want to accept the credit card offer to confirm the credit limit.
The system should notify transaction processing, send an email update to the customer, and trigger card printing and shipping.

---

### 7. Pull Excel Reports

As a Sales User, I want to generate an Excel report of all CC application forms in the system.
The report should include application ID, holder name, status, age, and sales handler for tracking purposes.

Do you also want me to make these **JIRA-style concise user stories with acceptance criteria** (Given/When/Then format), or just keep them in this simplified 2-line version?
