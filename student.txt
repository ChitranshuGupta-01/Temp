Information about credit cards is scattered across multiple sources.
Hidden charges and unclear terms confuse users.
Lack of effective comparison tools for rewards, interest rates, and fees.
Decision-making becomes time-consuming and frustrating.
Often leads to poor financial choices.


Proposed Solution:
A single platform integrating multiple credit card offers.
Provides easy and transparent side-by-side comparisons.
Highlights rewards, interest rates, fees, and benefits clearly.
Ensures a user-friendly interface for smooth navigation.
Uses real-time backend data for accurate and updated information
