Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage. In simple terms, it‚Äôs about keeping your digital information and devices safe from hackers, viruses, and other online threats.


Protection Areas ‚Äì

Network Security: Protecting your Wi-Fi, servers, and communication channels.

Application Security: Making sure software and apps don‚Äôt have security holes.

Information Security: Safeguarding data from theft or loss.

Cloud Security: Securing data stored online (e.g., Google Drive, AWS).

Endpoint Security: Protecting devices like laptops, phones, and tablets.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
1. Phishing

Fake emails or messages trick you into giving passwords or personal info.

Example: A fake bank email asks you to ‚Äúverify‚Äù your account.

2. Malware

Malicious software like viruses, worms, or ransomware infects your device.

Ransomware locks your files and demands payment to unlock them.

3. Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed DoS (DDoS)

Attackers overload a website or server with traffic, making it crash or unavailable.

4. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)

Attackers secretly intercept communication between two parties.

Example: Someone on public Wi-Fi steals your login info.

5. SQL Injection

Hackers insert malicious code into a website‚Äôs database query to access or change data.

6. Password Attacks

Guessing or cracking passwords using brute force or stolen password lists.

7. Zero-Day Exploits

Attacks that exploit a software vulnerability before developers can fix it.

8. Insider Threats

Employees or trusted people misuse access to steal or damage data.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

üî¥ 1. Phishing Attacks

Risk: Trick you into revealing passwords or sensitive data.
Mitigation:

Double-check sender addresses and URLs.

Don‚Äôt click unknown links or attachments.

Use email filters and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).

üî¥ 2. Malware & Ransomware

Risk: Infects devices, steals data, or locks files for ransom.
Mitigation:

Install and update antivirus/anti-malware software.

Keep your operating system and apps patched.

Avoid downloading from untrusted sites.

Maintain regular data backups offline or in secure cloud storage.

üî¥ 3. Weak or Stolen Passwords

Risk: Hackers gain unauthorized access.
Mitigation:

Use strong, unique passwords for each account.

Enable MFA wherever possible.

Use a password manager.

üî¥ 4. Data Breaches

Risk: Sensitive information (e.g., customer data) is leaked.
Mitigation:

Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.

Limit user access based on roles (least privilege).

Monitor systems for suspicious activity.

üî¥ 5. Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)

Risk: Overloads a website or service, making it unavailable.
Mitigation:

Use firewalls and DDoS protection services.

Distribute network resources using content delivery networks (CDNs).

üî¥ 6. Insider Threats

Risk: Employees or trusted individuals misuse access.
Mitigation:

Train employees on security best practices.

Implement strict access controls and activity monitoring.

üî¥ 7. Zero-Day Exploits

Risk: Hackers exploit unknown software vulnerabilities.
Mitigation:

Apply security patches quickly.

Use intrusion detection and prevention systems.

Perform regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
